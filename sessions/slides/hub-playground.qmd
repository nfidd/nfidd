### Turned loose!

We've covered a ton of material on creating, visualizing, evaluating and ensembling forecasts.

Now it's your turn to work more independently on these tasks in our "Sandbox Hub".

### Sandbox hub

Similar to our earlier ILI examples, but with data from multiple locations.
<br>
The [SISMID ILI Forecasting Sandbox](https://github.com/reichlab/sismid-ili-forecasting-sandbox/) is an actual, live hub.
<br>
Check out [the interactive dashboard](https://reichlab.io/sismid-ili-forecasting-dashboard/)!

### Model development workflow {.smaller}

Here is a summary of the forecasting workflow that we have covered in previous sessions:

<!-- - **EDA of the data**: what are important trends and features? -->
<!-- - **Model design**: what models do you want to build? -->
<!-- - **Model training and validation**: how will you validate your models on out-of-sample data? -->
<!-- - **Model testing**: will you do any prospective testing of your model? -->
<!-- - **EDA of forecasts and scores**:  -->
<!-- - **Pick a model and submit it** -->

<!-- - Some key concepts to highlight: -->
<!--  - time-series cross-validation -->
<!--  - trying to mask data from the analysts to avoid unconscious bias -->
