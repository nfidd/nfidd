# Further reading

The following is a highly subjective list of papers we would recommend to read for those interested in engaging further with the topics discussed here.

## Delay estimation
- Park et al., [Estimating epidemiological delay distributions for infectious diseases](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.12.24301247) provides a comprehensive overview of challenges in estimating delay distribution and how to overcome them.
- Charniga et al., [Best practices for estimating and reporting epidemiological delay distributions of infectious diseases using public health surveillance and healthcare data](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2405.08841) summarises challenges in estimating delay distributions into a set of best practices.

## $R_t$ estimation
- Gostic et al., [Practical considerations for measuring the effective reproductive number, $R_t$](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008409) provides an overview of some of the challenges in estimating reproduction numbers.
- Brockhaus et al., [Why are different estimates of the effective reproductive number so different? A case study on COVID-19 in Germany](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011653) compares reproduction number estimates from different models and investigates their differences.

## Nowcasting
- Wolffram et al., [Collaborative nowcasting of COVID-19 hospitalization incidences in Germany](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011394) compares the performance of a range of methods that were used in a nowcasting hub and investigates what might explain performance differences.
- Lison et al., [Generative Bayesian modeling to nowcast the effective reproduction number from line list data with missing symptom onset dates](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012021) develops a generative model for nowcasting and $R_t$ estimation and compares its performance to an approach where the steps for estimating incidence and reproduction number are separated.
- Stoner et al., [A Powerful Modelling Framework for Nowcasting and Forecasting COVID-19 and Other Diseases](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1912.05965) contains a nice review of different methods for nowcasting evaluates a range of methods, in addition to introducing a new approach.

## Forecasting
- Funk et al., [Assessing the performance of real-time epidemic forecasts: A case study of Ebola in the Western Area region of Sierra Leone, 2014-15](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006785) evaluates the performance of a forecasting method that combines a mechanistic SEIR model with a random walk prior for the reproduction number.
- Held et al, [Probabilistic forecasting in infectious disease epidemiology: the 13th Armitage lecture](https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.7363) makes a compelling argument for the use of probabilistic forecasts and evaluates spatial forecasts based on routine surveillance data.
- Lopez et al., [Challenges of COVID-19 Case Forecasting in the US, 2020-2021](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.05.30.23290732) describes the difficulty encountered in  making accurate forecasts in COVID-19 cases in the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub.
- Sherratt et al., [Predictive performance of multi-model ensemble forecasts of COVID-19 across European nations](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.81916) investigates the performance of different ensembles in the European COVID-19 Forecast Hub.
- Asher, [Forecasting Ebola with a regression transmission model](10.1016/j.epidem.2017.02.009) describes model that implements an extension to the random walk with a drift term.
- Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, [Forecasting: Principles and Practice (free online text book)](https://otexts.com/fpp3/) is a textbook on forecasting with a range of time series models and a great resource for finding out more about them.
