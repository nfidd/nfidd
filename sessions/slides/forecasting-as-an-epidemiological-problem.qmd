### Forecasting in infectious disease epidemiology

### Using models for statements about the future {.smaller}

Modelling the future can help decision making:

- how many beds to we need?
- where should we allocate vaccines?
- where should we trial vaccines?

However:

- not all modelling is prediction
- not all modelling of the future is forecasting

### Different ways of modelling the future {.smaller}

- **Nowcasts** make statements about current trends based on partial data

- **Forecasts** are *unconditional* statements about the future: what *will happen*

- **Scenarios** state what *would* happen under certain conditions

### Why nowcast/forecast? {.smaller}

- to create **situational awareness**
  - nowcast: where are we now?
  - forecast: where are we heading?

### CDC use of influenza forecasts

### Relationship with $R_t$ estimation {.smaller}

- In infectious disease epidemiology, "no change" means no change in $R_t$
- In that sense, predicting infections comes down to predicting $R_t$
- Commonly, forecast models assume no change in $R_t$. Is this a good assumption?

### Relationship with nowcasting {.smaller}

- Nowcast: we have **some** data from the dates we're predicting
- Forecast: we have **no** data from the dates we're predicting (usually: because they're in the future)

### Forecasts are usually *probabilistic* {.smaller}

- Because the future is uncertain, it is natural to express predictions in probabilities, e.g. there is a X% chance of exceeding Y hospital admissions.

### Importance of evaluation {.smaller}

- Because forecasts are *unconditional* (what will happen) we can compare them to data and see how well they did
- So-called **proper scoring rules** incentivise forecasters to express an honest belief about the future
- Many proper scoring rules (and other metrics) are available to assess probabilistic forecasts

### Forecasting paradigm {.smaller}

Maximise *sharpness* subject to *calibration*

- Statements about the future should be **correct** ("calibration")
- statements about the future should aim to have **narrow uncertainty** ("sharpness")

### Plan for this two sessions

1. Start with a simple model and use it to make a forecast (using stan)
2. Evaluate the forecasts using proper scoring rules
