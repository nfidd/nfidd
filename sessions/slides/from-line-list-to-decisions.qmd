### "We were losing ourselves in details [...] all we needed to know is, are the number of cases rising, falling or levelling off?"

Hans Rosling, Liberia, 2014

. . .

- what **is** the number of cases now?
- is it rising/falling and by how much?
- what does this mean for the near future?

### Data usually looks like this

![](figures/linelist.png)

### Aggregated data can look like this {.smaller}

[UKHSA, 2022](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monkeypox-outbreak-technical-briefings/investigation-into-monkeypox-outbreak-in-england-technical-briefing-1) <br>
[Overton et al., *PLOS Comp Biol*, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011463)

### Sometimes we can only access proxy data {.smaller}

**Influenza-like illness (ILI)**: fever AND additional "flu-like" symptom (cough, headache, sore throat, etc.)

- Used when direct case data isn't available
- Measures % of outpatient visits due to ILI

```{r ili-plot, fig.width=8, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
library(nfidd)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
data(flu_data)
flu_data <- flu_data |> filter(epiweek <= "2017-08-27")
ggplot(flu_data, aes(x = epiweek, y = wili)) +
  geom_path() +
  labs(title = "US ILI surveillance data (2003-2017)",
       x = "Epidemiological week", 
       y = "Weighted ILI (% of visits)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Aim of this course:

How can we use data typically collected for other purposes to answer questions like

- what **is** the number of cases now? (*nowcasting*)
- is it rising/falling and by how much? (*$R_t$ estimation*)
- what does this mean for the near future (*forecasting*)

in real time.

### Approach

Throughout the course we will

1. use models to simulate data sets in **R** <br>
(the *generative model* of the simulated data)
   
```{r outbreak-plot, fig.width=5, fig.height=3, fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)
library(nfidd)
### visualise the infection curve
data(infection_times)
ggplot(infection_times, aes(x = infection_time)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 10) +
  labs(
    x = "Infection time (in days)", y = "Number of infections",
    title = "Infections during an outbreak"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Approach

Throughout the course we will

2. apply generative models to simulated data in **Stan** to
   - learn about the system (conduct inference)
   - **make predictions** (nowcasting/forecasting)

### Approach

Throughout the course we will

3. In the second half we will shift to a **tools-focused approach** to demonstrate data driven forecasting and real-world applications

### Timeline

::: {.incremental}
- delay distributions and how to estimate them (day 1)
- $R_t$ estimation and nowcasting (day 2)
- forecasting, evaluation, and ensemble methods (day 2)
- forecasting hubs, applications, and linking nowcasting and forecasting (day 3)
