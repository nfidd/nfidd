## Delay estimation
- @parkEstimatingEpidemiologicalDelay2024 provide a comprehensive overview of challenges in estimating delay distribution and how to overcome them.
- @charnigaBestPracticesEstimating2024 summarises challenges in estimating delay distributions into a set of best practices.

## $R_t$ estimation
- @gosticPracticalConsiderationsMeasuring2020 provides an overview of some of the challenges in estimating reproduction numbers.
- @brockhausWhyAreDifferent2023 compares reproduction number estimates from different models and investigates their differences.

## Nowcasting
- @wolfframCollaborativeNowcastingCOVID192023 compares the performance of a range of methods that were used in a nowcasting hub and investigates what might explain performance differences.
- @lisonGenerativeBayesianModeling2024 develops a generative model for nowcasting and $R_t$ estimation and compares its performance to an approach where the steps for estimating incidence and reproduction number are separated.
- @stonerPowerfulModellingFramework2020 contains a nice review of different methods for nowcasting evaluates a range of methods, in addition to introducing a new approach.

## Forecasting
- @funkAssessingPerformanceRealtime2019 evaluates the performance of a forecasting method that combines a mechanistic SEIR model with a random walk prior for the reproduction number.
- @heldProbabilisticForecastingInfectious2017 makes a compelling argument for the use of probabilistic forecasts and evaluates spatial forecasts based on routine surveillance data.
- @lopezChallengesCOVID19Case2024 describes the difficulty encountered in  making accurate forecasts in COVID-19 cases in the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub.
- @asherForecastingEbolaRegression2018 describes model that implements an extension to the random walk with a drift term.
- @CDCgovWastewaterinformedcovidforecasting2025, code repo for [Wastewater-informed COVID-19 forecasting](https://github.com/CDCgov/wastewater-informed-covid-forecasting).
- @hyndmanForecastingPrinciplesPractice2021 is a free online text book on forecasting with a range of time series models and a great resource for finding out more about them.

## Ensembles
- @sherrattPredictivePerformanceMultimodel2023 investigates the performance of different ensembles in the European COVID-19 Forecast Hub.
- @amaralPostprocessingWeightedCombination2025 discusses the challenges in improving on the predictive performance of simpler approaches using weighted ensembles.
