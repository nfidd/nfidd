### Different ways of modelling the future {.smaller}

-   **Nowcasts** make statements about current trends based on partial data

-   **Forecasts** are *unconditional* statements about the future: what *will happen*

-   **Scenarios** state what *would* happen under certain conditions

### CDC use of influenza forecasts

### Forecasting: relationship with $R_t$ estimation {.smaller}

-   In infectious disease epidemiology, many relevant interventions and other changes affect the strength of **transmission**
-   Things that affect transmission don't affect the predicted outcomes directly, but via $R_t$
-   In that sense, predicting infections comes down to **predicting** $R_t$
-   Commonly, forecast models assume **no change** in $R_t$. Is this a good assumption?

### Forecasting: relationship with nowcasting {.smaller}

-   Nowcast: we have **some** data from the dates we're predicting
-   Forecast: we have **no** data from the dates we're predicting (usually b/c they're in the future)

### Forecasts are often *probabilistic* {.smaller}

-   Because the future is uncertain, it is natural to express predictions in probabilities, e.g. there is a X% chance of exceeding Y hospital admissions.

#### Camp A 

"It's a machine learning problem! We can gather enough data to make good predictions, and we don't really have to understand the underlying processes that well."

<br> 

#### Camp B

"We have clear theory that explains transmission of pathogens in a networked population. I don't need to confront my model's statements with data."

1.  Learn about and explore seasonal influenza-like illness data from US CDC.
2.  Build a simple forecast model and understand how it is represented in R.
