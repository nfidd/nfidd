### Motivating example {.smaller}

Often we want to forecast from data like this

![](figures/monkeypox_delayed.png)

Data after the dashed line are marked as uncertain. How can we use them for forecasting?

### The problem: Forecasting with incomplete data {.smaller}

**Traditional approach**: Wait for "complete" data

- Might mean forecasting from 2+ weeks ago
- But as we've seen, forecasts after 2 weeks can be difficult
- Even our forecasts of "what is happening now" end up quite uncertain

**The challenge**:
- Reporting delays mean recent data are incomplete
- But we need forecasts based on the most recent information
- How do we bridge this gap?

### Nowcasting reminder

Predict what an epidemiological time series will look like *after all delayed reports* are in.

### The nowcasting-forecasting continuum {.smaller}

**Key insight**: Nowcasting and forecasting aren't distinct

- As we saw in the renewal session, even nowcasting $R_t$ in real-time is partly a forecast
- Really we have a continuum of more or less information
- Some methods (e.g., Bayesian generative models) make this connection clear
- Others require more thought about how to link them

### Approach 1: Naive approach

- Filter to "complete" data only
- Standard forecast from truncated series
- **Problem**: Throws away recent information

### Approach 2: Simple correction

- Point estimate correction for truncation
- Forecast from "adjusted" data  
- **Problem**: No uncertainty propagation

### Approach 3: Simple correction with uncertainty

- Sample from nowcast posterior
- Forecast from multiple trajectories
- **Better**: Some uncertainty propagation
- **But**: Still treating nowcast and forecast as separate steps

### Approach 4: Joint model

- Simultaneous nowcast and forecast
- Full Bayesian inference
- **Advantage**: Proper uncertainty quantification
- **Trade-off**: More complex to implement

### Questions to consider {.smaller}

For each approach:

- How much data does it use?
- Where does uncertainty come from?
- What assumptions are we making?
- When might it work well or poorly?
