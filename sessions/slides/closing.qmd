### Aim of this course:

How can we use data typically collected in an outbreak to answer questions like

- what **is** the number of cases now? (*nowcasting*)
- is it rising/falling and by how much? (*$R_t$ estimation*)
- what does this mean for the near future (*forecasting*)

in real time.

### Timeline

::: {.incremental}
- delay distributions and how to estimate them (day 1)
- $R_t$ estimation and nowcasting (day 2)
- forecasting, evaluation, and ensemble methods (day 2)
- forecasting hubs, applications, and linking nowcasting and forecasting (day 3)
:::

# Key takeaways

### Day 1: Delay distributions {.smaller}

- delays play a fundamental role in nowcasting/forecasting
- we characterise them with probability distributions
- estimating delays requires correction for biases due to
  - **double interval censoring** (daily data)
  - **right truncation** (real-time analysis)

### Day 2: $R_t$ estimation {.smaller}

- **$R_t$ estimation** using the renewal equation is a convolution problem
- improving the generative model leads to improvements in estimation (**geometric random walk** vs. independent priors)
- **generation time** is a key delay distribution for transmission dynamics
- understanding the role of the generative model in the estimation of $R_t$

### Day 2: Nowcasting {.smaller}

- **nowcasting** is the task of predicting what data will look once delays have resolved
- it is a **right truncation problem** (same as discussed before)
- a **joint generative model** can combine delay estimation, nowcasting and $R_t$ estimation

### Day 2 (cont.): Forecasting and evaluation {.smaller}

- **forecasting** is the task of making unconditional statements about the future
- meaningful forecasts are **probabilistic**
- we can assess forecasts using **proper scoring rules** (MAE, RMSE, CRPS)
- methods include **ARIMA models**, **ensemble approaches**, and **time-series cross-validation**
- we can use visualisation and scoring to understand the predictive performance of different models

### Day 3: Collaborative modelling and applications {.smaller}

- **forecasting hubs** enable collaborative modelling efforts across institutions
- **hubverse tools** provide standardised formats for forecast submission and evaluation
- linking **nowcasting and forecasting** through joint or pipeline approaches
- the methods introduced here have **wide applications** in infectious disease epidemiology
- **open-source tools** are available to make this task easier in practice

### Outlook: Contributing to forecast hubs {.smaller}

- apply these methods in practice to learn about typical nowcast/forecast performance
- contribute to **collaborative forecast hubs** to compare approaches
- use **hubverse standards** for forecast formatting and submission
- example: European Respiratory Forecasting Hub
