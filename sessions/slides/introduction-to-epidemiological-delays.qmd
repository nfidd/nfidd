# Epidemiological delay

Time between two epidemiological events

## Epidemiological events: disease progression
- infection
- symptom onset
- becoming infectious
- hospital admission
- death

## Epidemiological events: recovery
- pathogen clearance
- symptoms clearance
- end of infectiousness
- discharge from hospital

## Epidemiological events: control

- quarantine
- isolation
- treatment

## Epidemiological events: reporting

- specimen taken
- report added to database

## Some delays have names

*infection* to *symptom onset*

. . .

**Incubation period**

## Some delays have names

*infection* to *becoming infectious*

. . .

**Latent period**

## Some delays have names

*becoming infectious* to *end of infectiousness*

. . .

**Infectious period**

## Some delays have names

hospital *admission* to *discharge*

. . .

**Length of stay**

## Some delays have names

*symptom onset* (person A) to *symptom onset* (person B, infected by A)

. . .

**Serial interval**

## Some delays have names

*infection* (person A) to *infection* (person B, infected by A)

. . .

**Generation interval**

## Why do we want to know these?

- Key elements of infectious disease epidemiology
- Intricate relationship with nowcasting/forecasting

## Quantifying delays

- Epidemiological delays are *variable*
- We can capture their variability using probability distributions

## Warning: Two levels of uncertainty {background-color="#000000" transition="fade-in" .smaller}

- Probability distributions characterise uncertainty in the delays
- Parameters of the probability distribution themselves can be uncertain
