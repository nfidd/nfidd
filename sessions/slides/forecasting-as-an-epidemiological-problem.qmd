# Motivating example

- During an outbreak but also e.g. during a flu season or a pandemic

# Meterological analogy

perhaps

# What is a forecast?

- an *unconditional* prediction: what **will** happen
- distinct from a *conditional* or *counterfactual* scenario: what **would** happen under certain conditions
- sometimes the counterfactual scenario is the forecast: what would happen if we didn't intervene (and then you don't)

# Why forecast?

- to create **situational awareness**
  - nowcast: where are we now?
  - forecast: where are we heading?

# Example uses of forecasts

- healthcare capacity planning
- vaccine trial planning

# Relationship with R estimation

- Commonest assumption is constant R ("no change")
- Is this a good forecast model?

# Difference to nowcast

- model takes over from data

# Importance of evaluation

- we can score forecasts (because they're unconditional) and nowcasts; this is much harder for conditional forecasts (are the conditions met)?

# Importance of uncertainty

- how certain we are about certain future outcomes is important
- providing uncertainty allows attributing probabilities to outcomes, i.e. X% chance of exceeding hospital capacity
- Makes evaluation more complicated (but not impossible)

# Plan for the next few sessions

1. Start with a simple model and use it to make a forecast (using stan)
2. Evaluate the forecasts
3. Try a range of forecasts + evaluate
