# From the individual to the population

## Individual delays

If $f(t)$ is our delay distribution then

$$
p(y_i) = f(y_i - x_i)
$$

is the probability that *secondary* event of individual $i$ happens at time $y_i$ given its primary event happened at $x_i$.

## Population level counts

The expected number of individuals $S_t$ that have their secondary event at time $t$ can then be calculated as the sum of these probabilities

$$
S_t = \sum_i f(t - x_i)
$$

## Population level counts

If the number of individuals $P_{t'}$ that have their primary event at time $t'$ then we can rewrite this as

$$
S_t = \sum_{t'} P_t' f(t - t')
$$

This operation is called a **convolution** of $P$ with $f$.

## Why use a convolution, not individual delays?

- we don't always have individual data available
- it is quicker to do the calculation at the individual level

- Simulate convolutions with infection counts
- Estimate parameters numbers of infections from number of symptom onsets, using a convolution model
