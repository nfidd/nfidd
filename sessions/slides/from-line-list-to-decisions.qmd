### "We were losing ourselves in details [...] all we needed to know is, are the number of cases rising, falling or levelling off?"

Hans Rosling, Liberia, 2014

. . .

- what **is** the number of cases now?
- is it rising/falling and by how much?
- what does this mean for the near future?

### Data usually looks like this {.smallest}

NOTE: not real data

### Aggregated data can look like this

### Aim of this course:

How can we use data typically collected in an outbreak to answer questions like

- what **is** the number of cases now? (*nowcasting*)
- is it rising/falling and by how much? (*R estimation*)
- what does this mean for the near future (*forecasting*)

in real time.

### Approach

Throughout the course we will

1. simulate typical infectious disease data in **R** <br>
(the *generative model*)
2. apply the generative model to data in **stan** to 
   - learn about the system (conduct inference)
   - make predictions (nowcasting/forecasting)

### Timeline

::: {.incremental}
- delay distributions and how to estimate them (Day 1)
- R estimation and the generation interval (Day 1)
- nowcasting (day 2)
- forecasting and evaluation, ensemble methods (day 2)
- applications (day 3)
