	abstract = {Over the last ten years, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has organized an annual influenza forecasting challenge with the motivation that accurate probabilistic forecasts could improve situational awareness and yield more effective public health actions. Starting with the 2021/22 influenza season, the forecasting targets for this challenge have been based on hospital admissions reported in the CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) surveillance system. Reporting of influenza hospital admissions through NHSN began within the last few years, and as such only a limited amount of historical data are available for this target signal. To produce forecasts in the presence of limited data for the target surveillance system, we augmented these data with two signals that have a longer historical record: 1) ILI+, which estimates the proportion of outpatient doctor visits where the patient has influenza; and 2) rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations at a selected set of healthcare facilities. Our model, Flusion, is an ensemble model that combines two machine learning models using gradient boosting for quantile regression based on different feature sets with a Bayesian autoregressive model. The gradient boosting models were trained on all three data signals, while the autoregressive model was trained on only data for the target surveillance signal, NHSN admissions; all three models were trained jointly on data for multiple locations. In each week of the influenza season, these models produced quantiles of a predictive distribution of influenza hospital admissions in each state for the current week and the following three weeks; the ensemble prediction was computed by averaging these quantile predictions. Flusion emerged as the top-performing model in the CDC’s influenza prediction challenge for the 2023/24 season. In this article we investigate the factors contributing to Flusion’s success, and we find that its strong performance was primarily driven by the use of a gradient boosting model that was trained jointly on data from multiple surveillance signals and multiple locations. These results indicate the value of sharing information across multiple locations and surveillance signals, especially when doing so adds to the pool of available training data.},

We study methods for building an ensemble that combines forecasts from these teams. These experiments have informed the ensemble methods used by the Hub. To be most useful to policymakers, ensemble forecasts must have stable performance in the presence of two key characteristics of the component forecasts: (1) occasional misalignment with the reported data, and (2) instability in the relative performance of component forecasters over time. Our results indicate that in the presence of these challenges, an untrained and robust approach to ensembling using an equally weighted median of all component forecasts is a good choice to support public health decision-makers. In settings where some contributing forecasters have a stable record of good performance, trained ensembles that give those forecasters higher weight can also be helpful.},

	abstract = {Seasonal influenza results in substantial annual morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide. Accurate forecasts of key features of influenza epidemics, such as the timing and severity of the peak incidence in a given season, can inform public health response to outbreaks. As part of ongoing efforts to incorporate data and advanced analytical methods into public health decision-making, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has organized seasonal influenza forecasting challenges since the 2013/2014 season. In the 2017/2018 season, 22 teams participated. A subset of four teams created a research consortium called the FluSight Network in early 2017. During the 2017/2018 season they worked together to produce a collaborative multi-model ensemble that combined 21 separate component models into a single model using a machine learning technique called stacking. This approach creates a weighted average of predictive densities where the weight for each component is determined by maximizing overall ensemble accuracy over past seasons. In the 2017/2018 influenza season, one of the largest seasonal outbreaks in the last 15 years, this multi-model ensemble performed better on average than all individual component models and placed second overall in the CDC challenge. It also outperformed the baseline multi-model ensemble created by the CDC that took a simple average of all models submitted to the forecasting challenge. This project shows that collaborative efforts between research teams to develop ensemble forecasting approaches can bring measurable improvements in forecast accuracy and important reductions in the variability of performance from year to year. Efforts such as this, that emphasize real-time testing and evaluation of forecasting models and facilitate the close collaboration between public health officials and modeling researchers, are essential to improving our understanding of how best to use forecasts to improve public health response to seasonal and emerging epidemic threats.},

	abstract = {Background With enough advanced notice, dengue outbreaks can be mitigated. As a climate-sensitive disease, environmental conditions and past patterns of dengue can be used to make predictions about future outbreak risk. These predictions improve public health planning and decision-making to ultimately reduce the burden of disease. Past approaches to dengue forecasting have used seasonal climate forecasts, but the predictive ability of a system using different lead times in a year-round prediction system has been seldom explored. Moreover, the transition from theoretical to operational systems integrated with disease control activities is rare. Methods and findings We introduce an operational seasonal dengue forecasting system for Vietnam where Earth observations, seasonal climate forecasts, and lagged dengue cases are used to drive a superensemble of probabilistic dengue models to predict dengue risk up to 6 months ahead. Bayesian spatiotemporal models were fit to 19 years (2002–2020) of dengue data at the province level across Vietnam. A superensemble of these models then makes probabilistic predictions of dengue incidence at various future time points aligned with key Vietnamese decision and planning deadlines. We demonstrate that the superensemble generates more accurate predictions of dengue incidence than the individual models it incorporates across a suite of time horizons and transmission settings. Using historical data, the superensemble made slightly more accurate predictions (continuous rank probability score [CRPS] = 66.8, 95\% CI 60.6–148.0) than a baseline model which forecasts the same incidence rate every month (CRPS = 79.4, 95\% CI 78.5–80.5) at lead times of 1 to 3 months, albeit with larger uncertainty. The outbreak detection capability of the superensemble was considerably larger (69\%) than that of the baseline model (54.5\%). Predictions were most accurate in southern Vietnam, an area that experiences semi-regular seasonal dengue transmission. The system also demonstrated added value across multiple areas compared to previous practice of not using a forecast. We use the system to make a prospective prediction for dengue incidence in Vietnam for the period May to October 2020. Prospective predictions made with the superensemble were slightly more accurate (CRPS = 110, 95\% CI 102–575) than those made with the baseline model (CRPS = 125, 95\% CI 120–168) but had larger uncertainty. Finally, we propose a framework for the evaluation of probabilistic predictions. Despite the demonstrated value of our forecasting system, the approach is limited by the consistency of the dengue case data, as well as the lack of publicly available, continuous, and long-term data sets on mosquito control efforts and serotype-specific case data. Conclusions This study shows that by combining detailed Earth observation data, seasonal climate forecasts, and state-of-the-art models, dengue outbreaks can be predicted across a broad range of settings, with enough lead time to meaningfully inform dengue control. While our system omits some important variables not currently available at a subnational scale, the majority of past outbreaks could be predicted up to 3 months ahead. Over the next 2 years, the system will be prospectively evaluated and, if successful, potentially extended to other areas and other climate-sensitive disease systems.},

The properties of the forecast combination are typically derived under the assumption that the weights are fixed, while in practice they need to be estimated. If the fact that the weights are random rather than fixed is taken into account during the optimality derivation, then the forecast combination will be biased (even when the original forecasts are unbiased), and its variance will be larger than in the fixed-weight case. In particular, there is no guarantee that the ‘optimal’ forecast combination will be better than the equal-weight case, or even improve on the original forecasts. We provide the underlying theory, some special cases, and a numerical illustration.},

	abstract = {Considerable literature has accumulated over the years regarding the combination of forecasts. The primary conclusion of this line of research is that forecast accuracy can be substantially improved through the combination of multiple individual forecasts. Furthermore, simple combination methods often work reasonably well relative to more complex combinations. This paper provides a review and annotated bibliography of that literature, including contributions from the forecasting, psychology, statistics, and management science literatures. The objectives are to provide a guide to the literature for students and researchers and to help researchers locate contributions in specific areas, both theoretical and applied. Suggestions for future research directions include (1) examination of simple combining approaches to determine reasons for their robustness, (2) development of alternative uses of multiple forecasts in order to make better use of the information they contain, (3) use of combined forecasts as benchmarks for forecast evaluation, and (4) study of subjective combination procedures. Finally, combining forecasts should become part of the mainstream of forecasting practice. In order to achieve this, practitioners should be encouraged to combine forecasts, and software to produce combined forecasts easily should be made available.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2205.07090},
	abstract = {Evaluating forecasts is essential to understand and improve forecasting and make forecasts useful to decision makers. A variety of R packages provide a broad variety of scoring rules, visualisations and diagnostic tools. One particular challenge, which scoringutils aims to address, is handling the complexity of evaluating and comparing forecasts from several forecasters across multiple dimensions such as time, space, and different types of targets. scoringutils extends the existing landscape by offering a convenient and flexible data.table-based framework for evaluating and comparing probabilistic forecasts (forecasts represented by a full predictive distribution). Notably, scoringutils is the first package to offer extensive support for probabilistic forecasts in the form of predictive quantiles, a format that is currently used by several infectious disease Forecast Hubs. The package is easily extendable, meaning that users can supply their own scoring rules or extend existing classes to handle new types of forecasts. scoringutils provides broad functionality to check the data and diagnose issues, to visualise forecasts and missing data, to transform data before scoring, to handle missing forecasts, to aggregate scores, and to visualise the results of the evaluation. The paper presents the package and its core functionality and illustrates common workflows using example data of forecasts for COVID-19 cases and deaths submitted to the European COVID-19 Forecast Hub.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2412.08916},
	abstract = {Ensemble forecasts often outperform forecasts from individual standalone models, and have been used to support decision-making and policy planning in various fields. As collaborative forecasting efforts to create effective ensembles grow, so does interest in understanding individual models' relative importance in the ensemble. To this end, we propose two practical methods that measure the difference between ensemble performance when a given model is or is not included in the ensemble: a leave-one-model-out algorithm and a leave-all-subsets-of-models-out algorithm, which is based on the Shapley value. We explore the relationship between these metrics, forecast accuracy, and the similarity of errors, both analytically and through simulations. We illustrate this measure of the value a component model adds to an ensemble in the presence of other models using US COVID-19 death forecasts. This study offers valuable insight into individual models' unique features within an ensemble, which standard accuracy metrics alone cannot reveal.},
