## Ensembles

- Combine many different models' forecasts into a single prediction

## Why ensemble?

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Many uncertainties, many approaches: many models

   - Layers of uncertainty
  
      - Model parameters
        - e.g. parameterising delay distributions
        
      - Model structure
        - e.g. more mechanistic or more statistical approaches
   - Want to use all available information
:::

## Why ensemble?

"Whole is greater than sum of parts"

   - Average of multiple predictions is often more performant than any individual model
   
      - History in weather & economic forecasting
      
      - Seen this in infectious disease forecasting

        - "Forecast challenges": Ebola, dengue, flu, COVID-19...

## Ensemble methods

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

- Summarising across models to create single (probabilistic) prediction

  - e.g. average at each models' probabilistic quantiles

     - Mean

     - Median - trims the outliers, so narrows the uncertainty
:::

## Ensemble methods

- Equal or weighted combination

   - Weight models by past forecast performance
   
      - e.g. using forecast scores
      
   - Rarely better than equal average

## Collaborative modelling

### "Forecast hubs"

- Crowdsourcing forecasts

   - Open source collaborative projects 

   - Anyone able to contribute a forecast
   
- Forecasts ensembled into a single projection
   
- Also enables consistent evaluation

## 

Infectious disease forecasting hubs have grown in popularity over the last decade

1. Create unweighted and weighted ensembles using forecasts from multiple models.
2. Evaluate the forecasts from ensembles compared to their constituent models.
