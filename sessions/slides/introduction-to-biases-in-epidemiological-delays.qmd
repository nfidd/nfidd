# Biases in epidemiological delays

Why might our estimates of epidemiological delays be biased?

. . .

::: {.fragment .fade-out}
- data reliability and representativeness
:::
- intrinsic issues with data collection and recording

## Issue #1: Double censoring

- reporting of events usually as a **date** (not date + precise time)
- for short delays this can make quite a difference

## Double censoring: example {.smaller}

We are trying to estimate an incubation period. For person A we know exposure happened on day 1 and symptom onset on day 3.

The *true* incubation period of A could be anywhere between 1 and 3 days (but not all equally likely).

## Issue #2: right truncation

- reporting of events can be triggered by the **second** event
- in that case, longer delays might be missing because they **have not occurred yet**

## Example: right truncation {.smaller}

We are trying to estimate an incubation period. Each arrow represents one person with an associated pair of events (infection and symptom onset).

## Example: right truncation {.smaller}

We are trying to estimate an incubation period. Each arrow represents one person with an associated pair of events (infection and symptom onset).

## Example: right truncation {.smaller}

We are trying to estimate an incubation period. Each arrow represents one person with an associated pair of events (infection and symptom onset).

![](figures/truncation_final.png)

## Example: right truncation {.smaller}

We are trying to estimate an incubation period. Each arrow represents one person with an associated pair of events (infection and symptom onset)

On the day of analysis we have not observed some delays yet, and these tended to be longer.
