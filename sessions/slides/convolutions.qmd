## Individual delay distributions {.smaller}

Let us consider an epidemiological process that is characterised by a discrete distribution $f_d$.

. . .

**Example:**

$f_d$: Probability of having incubation period of $d$ days.

```{r echo = FALSE, include = TRUE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
library(ggplot2)
library(nfidd)
ip_pmf <- make_ip_pmf()
ggplot(data.frame(ip_pmf), aes(x = Var1, y = Freq)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Incubation period", y= "Probability") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Individual to population: A simple example

If we know individual events, we can add a draw from the delay distribution and sum up the resulting delays.

```{r echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
# Create a simple schematic showing individual delays
set.seed(123)
infections <- data.frame(
  person = paste("Person", 1:6),
  infection_day = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3),
  delay = c(2, 4, 1, 3, 2, 5),
  onset_day = c(3, 5, 3, 5, 5, 8)
)

# Create a schematic plot
ggplot(infections, aes(y = person)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = infection_day, xend = onset_day), 
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm")), size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(aes(x = infection_day), color = "red", size = 5) +
  geom_point(aes(x = onset_day), color = "blue", size = 5) +
  labs(x = "Day", y = "Individual", 
       title = "Individual delays from infection to symptom onset") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:8)
```

## Why not use individual delays?

- we don't always have individual data available
- we often model other processes at the population level (such as transmission) and so being able to model delays on the same scale is useful
- doing the computation at the population level requires fewer calculations (i.e. is faster)

- **however, a downside is that we won't have realistic uncertainty, especially if the number of individuals is small**

## Convolution: From individual to population

## Population level counts: The mathematics

If the number of individuals $P_{t'}$ that have their primary event at time $t'$ then we can rewrite this as

$$
S_t = \sum_{t'} P_{t'} f_{t - t'}
$$

This operation is called a (discrete) **convolution** of $P$ with $f_d$.

We can use convolutions with the delay distribution that applies at the *individual* level to determine *population-level* counts.

## What if $f$ is continuous?

Having moved to the population level, we can't estimate individual-level event times any more.

Instead, we *discretise* the distribution (remembering that it is **double censored** - as both events are censored). 

This can be solved mathematically but in the session we will use simulation.

- Simulate convolutions with infection counts
- Discretise continuous distributions
- Estimate parameters numbers of infections from number of symptom onsets, using a convolution model
