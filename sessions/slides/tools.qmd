### Timeline so far

- delay distributions and how to estimate them (day 1)
- $R_t$ estimation and the generation interval (day 1)
- nowcasting (day 2)
- forecasting and evaluation, ensemble methods (day 2)
- applications (day 3)

### Available tools or custom implementation?

A few open-source tools implement some or all of the methods we have encountered in the course.

### Available tools or custom implementation?

- Loses flexibility of custom approaches

  - different epidemiological problems, different data - different methods?

### Available tools or custom implementation?

- Value of using - and contributing

  - avoids duplication
  
  - improves the chances of finding errors
  
  - helps discussing and ultimately enforcing best practice
