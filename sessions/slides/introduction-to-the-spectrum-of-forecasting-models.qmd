## Different types of models {.smaller}

- We can classify models by the level of mechanism they include
- All of the model types we will introduce in the next few slides have been used for COVID-19 forecasting (the US and/or European COVID-19 forecast hub)

**NOTE:**  level of mechanism $\neq$ model complexity

**Complex agent-based models**

Conceptually probably the closest to meteorological forecasting, if with much less real-time data.

**Compartmental models**

Aim to capture relevant mechanisms but without going to the individual level.

**Semi-mechanistic models**

- Include some epidemiological mechanism (e.g. SIR or the renewal equation)
- Add a nonmechanistic time component inspired by statistical models (e.g. random walk)
- e.g., the model we have worked with so far

**Statistical models**

- Models that don't include any epidemiological background e.g. ARIMA; also called *time-series models*
- The random walk model when used on its own (without going via $R_t$) is called a [stochastic volatility model](https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/time-series.html#stochastic-volatility-models)

1. Review the performance of the random walk model
2. Motivate a mechanism to order to address some of the issues
3. Motivate a statistical approach aiming to address the same issues
4. Compare the performance of these models for a single forecast
5. Evaluate many forecast from these models and compare their performance
