[From an epidemiological line list to informing decisions in real-time](slides/from-line-list-to-decisions.qmd)

### Aim of the course

How can we use data typically collected in an outbreak to answer questions like

-   what is the number of cases now (*nowcasting*)
-   is the outbreak rising/falling and by how much (*R estimation*)
-   what does this mean for the near future (*forecasting*)

in real time?

To answer these questions, we need to understand the epidemiological processes that create the kinds of data that we typically have available for outbreak analysis.

::: callout
Let's look at outbreak data from the perspective of an individual infection.
There are two types of processes happening:

-   upwards, from an individual infection through to being recorded in outbreak data; and

-   outwards, from each infection spreading to cause new infections in the outbreak.

Both of these processes involve time delays and potential biases, which makes analysing data in real time during an outbreak especially tricky.
:::

In this course, we first focus on making sense of the delays and biases in the data we are able to access in real time during an outbreak.
We'll combine this with the process of infectious disease transmission, with the reproduction number as the key.
With that, we can start to interpret the present (nowcasting) and predict the future (forecasting).

### Why this course?

-   common questions in outbreak response
-   easy to make mistakes
-   no comprehensive training resource

### Approach

Throughout the course we will

1.  simulate typical infectious disease data in **R** (the *generative model*)
2.  apply the generative model to data in the probabilistic programming language **stan**, to
    -   learn about the system (conduct inference)
    -   make predictions (nowcasting/forecasting)

### Timeline for the course

-   delay distributions and how to estimate them (day 1)
-   R estimation and the generation interval (day 1)
-   nowcasting (day 2)
-   forecasting and evaluation, ensemble methods (day 2)
-   applications (day 3)
