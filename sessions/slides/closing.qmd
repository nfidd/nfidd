### Aim of this course:

How can we use data typically collected in an outbreak to answer questions like

::: {.incremental}
- what **is** the number of cases now? (*nowcasting*)
- is it rising/falling and by how much? (*$R_t$ estimation*)
- what does this mean for the near future (*forecasting*)
:::

in real time.

### Timeline 

- delay distributions and how to estimate them (day 1)
- $R_t$ estimation and the generation interval (day 1)
- nowcasting (day 2)
- forecasting and evaluation (day 2)
- ensemble methods (day 3)
- applications (day 3)

# Key takeaways

### Day 1: Delay distributions {.smaller}

- delays play a fundamental role in nowcasting/forecasting
- we characterise them with probability distributions
- estimating delays requires correction for biases due to
  - **double interval censoring** (daily data)
  - **right truncation** (real-time analysis)

### Day 1 (cont.): Convolutions {.smaller}

- we can use **convolutions** to model delays at the population scale
- when doing so we need to make sure to account for **double interval censoring**
- **$R_t$ estimation** using the renewal equation is a convolution problem
- improving the generative model leads to improvements in estimation
   - **geometric random walk** vs. independent priors

### Day 2: Nowcasting {.smaller}

- **nowcasting** is the task of predicting what data will look once delays have resolved
- it is a **right truncation problem** (same as discussed before)
- a **joint generative model** can combine delay estimation, nowcasting and $R_t$ estimation

### Day 2 (cont.): Forecasting {.smaller}

- **forecasting** is the task of making unconditional statements about the future
- meaningful forecasts are **probabilistic**
- we can assess forecasts using **proper scoring rules**
- a wide range of methods are available for making forecasts
- we can use visualisation and scoring to understand the predictive performance of different models

### Day 3: Ensembles {.smaller}

- range of strategies for collating and combining models
- evaluation useful for model interpretation
- this might change depending on the use case

### Day 3: Applications {.smaller}
- the methods introduced here have **wide applications** in infectious disease epidemiology
- **open-source tools** are available to make this task easier in practice
- rapid development and many open questions
