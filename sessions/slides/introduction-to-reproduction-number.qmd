Prior for infections at time $t$ is independent from infections at all other time points. Is this reasonable?

## Infections depend on previous infections

Remember the definition of the generation time distribution $g(t)$:

*infection* (person A) to *infection* (person B, infected by A)

Through this, infections depend on previous infections:

$$
I_t = \mathrm{scaling} \times \sum_{t' < t} I_t' g(t - t')
$$

What is this scaling?

## Scaling of infections with previous infections

Let's assume we have $I_0$ infections at time 0, and the scaling doesn't change in time.

Who many people will they go on to infect?

. . .

$$
I = \mathrm{scaling} \times \sum_{t=0}^\infty I_0 g(t) = \mathrm{scaling} * I_0
$$

The scaling can be interpreted as the reproduction number $R$.

## The renewal equation

If $R_t$ can change over time, it can still be interpreted as the ("instantaneous") repreoduction number:

$$
I_t = R_t \times \sum_{t' < t} I_t' g(t - t')
$$

## The time-varying reproduction number

We can estimate $R_t$ from a time series of infections using the renewal equation.

What are some other ways of estatimating it?

- Simulate infections using the renewal equation
- Estimate reproduction numbers using a time series of infections
- Combine with delay distributions to jointly infer infections and R from a time series of outcomes
