#' Discretise a Continuous Delay Distribution
#'
#' This function discretises a continuous delay distribution into a probability
#' mass function (PMF) over discrete days.
#'
#' @param rgen A function that generates random delays, e.g., `rgamma`,
#' `rlnorm`.
#' @param max The maximum delay.
#' @param n The number of replicates to simulate. Defaults to `1e+6`.
#' @param ... Additional parameters of the delay distribution.
#'
#' @return A vector of probabilities corresponding to discrete indices from
#'   `0` to `max`, representing the discretised delay distribution.

  ## now,  simulate the exact time of the second event
  second <- first + rgen(n, ...)
  ## round down to get the delay in days
  delay <- floor(second)

  pmf <- counts / sum(counts)
  ## return
  return(pmf)
