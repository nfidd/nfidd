To install the packages needed in the course, including the `nfiidd` package that contains data files used, you can use the `remotes` package:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("nfiidd/nfiidd", dependencies = TRUE)
```

Then you can check that the installation completed successfully by loading the package into your **R** session:

```{r load, eval=FALSE}
library("nfiidd")
```
