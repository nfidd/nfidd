### Why statistical concepts?

- We'll need to estimate things (delays, reproduction numbers, case numbers now and in the future)

- We'll want to correctly specify uncertainty

- We'll want to incorporate our domain expertise

- We'll do this using *Bayesian inference*

## Bayesian inference: an overview

### Probability distributions (discrete) {.smaller}

```{r create_poisson_plot}
kicks <- seq(0, 6)
prob <- dpois(kicks, lambda = 0.61)
df <- data.frame(kicks = kicks, prob = prob)
pp <- ggplot(df, aes(x = kicks, y = prob)) +
  theme_bw(20) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  ylab("Probability") +
  xlab("Number of kicks")
```

- E.g., how many people die of horse kicks if there are 0.61 kicks per year
- Described by the *Poisson* distribution

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r plot_poisson1}
pp
```

::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Two directions
1. Calculate the probability
2. Randomly sample

        mean = 23,

## Bayesian inference in 15 minutes {.smaller}

![](figures/bayesian_model_without_distributions.png)

The generative model can produce output which looks like data given a set of parameters $\theta$.

Idea of Bayesian inference: treat $\theta$ as **random variables** (with a probability distribution) and **condition on data**: posterior probability $p(\theta | \mathrm{data})$ as target of inference.

### Bayes' rule {.smaller}

- We treat the parameters of the a $\theta$ as random with *prior probabilities* given by a distribution $p(\theta)$. Confronting the model with data we obtain *posterior probabilities*  $p(\theta | \mathrm{data})$, our target of inference. Applying the rule of conditional probabilities, we can write this as

$$ p(\theta | \textrm{data}) = \frac{p(\textrm{data} | \theta) p(\theta)}{p(\textrm{data})}$$

- $p(\textrm{data} | \theta)$ is the /likelihood/
- $p(\textrm{data})$ is a /normalisation constant/

- In words,
  $$\textrm{(posterior)} \propto \textrm{(normalised likelihood)} \times \textrm{(prior)}$$

### Bayesian inference

![](figures/bayesian_model.png)

### MCMC

- Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a method to generate *samples* of $\theta$ that come from the *posterior distribution* given $\textrm{data}, i.e the **target** of inference.
- Many flavours of MCMC exist: Metropolis-Hastings, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, etc.

## What is stan and why do we use it?

- a *Probabilistic Programming Language* for Bayesian inference
  (i.e., a way to write down models)
  
- models are written in a text file (often ending `.stan`) and then loaded into an R/python/etc interface

- once a model is written down, stan can be used to **generate samples** from the **posterior distribution** (using a variety of methods)

## How to write a model in stan {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
In a stan model file we specify:

- Data<br>(types and names)

- Parameters<br>(types and names)

- Model<br>(prior and likelihood)
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

```{stan empty_model, output.var = "empty", eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
data {

parameters {

model {

## Example: fairness of a coin {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

Data:

- $N$ coin flips

- $x$ times heads

Parameters

- $\theta$, probability of getting heads; uniform prior in $[0, 1]$

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

```{stan coin_model, output.var = "coin", eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, file = nfidd::nfidd_cmdstan_model("coin")
```

## Using stan from R {.smaller}

There are two packages for using stan from R. We will use the `cmdstanr` package:

```{r load_coin_model, echo = TRUE}
library("cmdstanr")
mod <- nfidd::nfidd_cmdstan_model("coin")
mod
```

## Sampling from the posterior {.xmaller}

```{r sample_from_coin_model, echo = TRUE}
data <- list(
  N = 10, ## 10 coin flips
  x = 6 ## 6 times heads
)
nfidd::nfidd_sample(mod, data = data)
```
