## Ensembles

- Combine many different models' forecasts into a single prediction

## Why ensemble?

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Many uncertainties, many approaches: many models

   - Layers of uncertainty
  
      - Model parameters
        - e.g. parameterising delay distributions
        
      - Model structure
        - e.g. more mechanistic or more statistical approaches
   - Want to use all available information
:::

## Why ensemble?

"Whole is greater than sum of parts"

   - Average of multiple predictions is often more performant than any individual model
   
      - History in weather & economic forecasting
      
      - Seen this in infectious disease forecasting

        - "Forecast challenges": Ebola, dengue, flu, COVID-19...

## Ensemble methods

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

- Summarising across models

  - e.g. average at each models' probabilistic quantiles

     - Mean

     - Median - trims the outliers, so narrows the uncertainty
:::

## Ensemble methods

- Equal or weighted combination

   - Weight models by past forecast performance
   
      - e.g. using forecast scores
      
   - Rarely better than equal average

## Collaborative modelling

- "Forecast hubs": crowdsourcing forecasts

   - Open source collaborative projects 

   - Anyone able to contribute a forecast
      - Used for e.g. flu, dengue, COVID-19 
   
   - Forecasts ensembled into a single projection
   
   - Enables consistent evaluation

## When are ensembles useful?

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

  - Ensemble reduces variance

    - (+) Stable

    - (-) Can't explore extremes
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

  - Dependent on components

    - (+) Ensemble typically more accurate than any individual component

    - (-) Obscures mechanisms
:::

## Ensembles: reflections

   - Comparing uncertainties
      - Which aspects of uncertainty do we want to keep (compare), or combine?
   
   - Collaborative modelling
      - Opportunity for exchange & evaluation
      - Consensus - at the cost of context?
