### Forecasting in infectious disease epidemiology

### Using models for statements about the future {.smaller}

Modelling the future can help decision making:

- how many beds do we need?
- where should we allocate vaccines?
- where should we trial vaccines?

However:

- not all modelling is prediction
- not all modelling of the future is forecasting

### Different ways of modelling the future {.smaller}

- **Nowcasts** make statements about current trends based on partial data

- **Forecasts** are *unconditional* statements about the future: what *will happen*

- **Scenarios** state what *would* happen under certain conditions

### Why nowcast/forecast? {.smaller}

- to create **situational awareness**
  - nowcast: where are we now?
  - forecast: where are we heading?

### CDC use of influenza forecasts

### Relationship with $R_t$ estimation {.smaller}

- In infectious disease epidemiology, many relevant interventions and other changes affect the strength of **transmission**
- Things that affect transmission don't affect the predicted outcomes directly, but via $R_t$
- In that sense, predicting infections comes down to **predicting $R_t$**
- Commonly, forecast models assume **no change** in $R_t$. Is this a good assumption?

### Relationship with nowcasting {.smaller}

- Nowcast: we have **some** data from the dates we're predicting
- Forecast: we have **no** data from the dates we're predicting (usually: because they're in the future)

### Forecasts are usually *probabilistic* {.smaller}

- Because the future is uncertain, it is natural to express predictions in probabilities, e.g. there is a X% chance of exceeding Y hospital admissions.

1. Load some forecasts we have generated and visualise them alongside the data.
2. Explore different ways of visualising forecasts to assess how good the model performs at forecasting.
