# Nowcasting and forecasting infectious disease dynamics

This repository contains the material to create the nfiidd course page.

All the raw material is in the folder `Rmd/` and is written in `Rmarkdown`. Any
changes to the Rmarkdown files are automatically updated on the web site once
committed to the `main` branch.

To add a lesson, add an Rmd file in `Rmd/` and edit `Rmd/_site.yml` so it
appears in the menu.

## Local testing

The `html` pages can be generated locally using the function

```{r render, eval = FALSE}
rmarkdown::render_site("Rmd/")
```

This creates the `html` pages in the `Rmd/_site` directory.
