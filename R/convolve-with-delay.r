#' Convolve a Time Series with a Delay Distribution
#'
#' This function convolves a time series with a delay distribution given as a
#' probability mass function (PMF).
#'
#' @param ts A vector of the time series to convolve.
#' @param delay_pmf The probability mass function of the delay, given as a
#'  vector of probabilities, corresponding to discrete indices 0, 1, 2 of the
#'  discretised delay distribution.
#'
#' @return A vector of the convolved time series.
