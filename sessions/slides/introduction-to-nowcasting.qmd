### Motivating example {.smaller}

Often we see data like this

Data after the dashed line are marked as uncertain. What, if anything, do they tell us about current trends?

### 

These patterns arise because:

- Epidemiological time series are aggregated by the *epidemiologically meaningful date*
  (e.g. symptom onset, hospital admission, death)
- There is a *delay* between this date, and the events showing up in the data
- This leads to an "articifial" *dip* in the most recent data

### The aim of nowcasting

Predict what an epidemiological time series will look like *after all delayed reports* are in.

### Nowcasting as right truncation

Remember from [biases in delay estimation](../biases-in-delay-distributions):

**Right truncation**

- reporting of events can be triggered by the **secondary** event
- in that case, longer delays might be missing because whilst the *primary events* have occurred the *secondary events* **have not occurred yet**

Nowcasting is exactly this if the seondary event is the data being available for analysis.

### Nowcasting as a population-level problem

If we don't have individual-level data, we can estimate the delay distribution of reporting from multiple snapshots

### This session

1. Perform nowcast with a known reporting delay distribution
2. Joint estimation of delay and nowcast
3. Joint estimation of R_t, delay and nowcast
