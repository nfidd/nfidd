## Convolution session {.smaller}

```{stan, file = system.file("stan", "estimate-infections.stan", package = "nfidd"), eval = FALSE, output.var = "mod"}
#| code-line-numbers: "|23"
```

. . .

Prior for infections at time $t$ is independent from infections at all other time points.
Is this reasonable?

## What if we convolve infections with infections?

We can extend the convolution concept from the last session:

- **Previous session:** infections → symptoms (via incubation period)
- **This session:** infections → infections (via generation time)

## Generation time: infection to infection

Here rather than the time from *infection* (person A) to *symptoms* (person B, infected by A) we have the time from *infection* (person A) to *infection* (person B, infected by A).

This is known as the generation time distribution ($g(t)$).

## Generation time: notation

We can write the convolution as:

$$
I_t = \mathrm{scaling} \times \sum_{t' < t} I_t' g(t - t')
$$

However, unlike the infection to symptoms case here we don't assume that the two time series have the same magnitude so need to introduce a scaling.

. . .

**What is this scaling?**

## The renewal equation as a convolution

## The scaling factor: reproduction number

Let's assume we have $I_0$ infections at time 0, and the scaling doesn't change in time.

How many people will they go on to infect?

. . .

$$
I = \mathrm{scaling} \times \sum_{t=0}^\infty I_0 g(t) = \mathrm{scaling} * I_0
$$

The scaling can be interpreted as the reproduction number $R_0$ (assuming a susceptible population).

## The renewal equation

If $R_t$ can change over time, it can be interpreted as the ("instantaneous") reproduction number:

$$
I_t = R_t \times \sum_{t' < t} I_t' g(t - t')
$$

We can estimate $R_t$ from a time series of infections using the renewal equation.

-   Simulate infections using the renewal equation
-   Estimate reproduction numbers using a time series of infections
-   Combine with delay distributions to jointly infer infections and R from a time series of outcomes
