## Biases in epidemiological delays

Why might our estimates of epidemiological delays be biased?

. . .

::: {.fragment .fade-out}
- data reliability and representativeness
:::
- intrinsic issues with data collection and recording

## Issue #1: Double censoring

- reporting of events usually as a **date** (not date + precise time)
- for short delays this can make quite a difference
- accounting for it incorrectly can introduce more bias than doing nothing

## Double censoring: example {.smaller}

We are trying to estimate an incubation period. For person A we know exposure happened on day 1 and symptom onset on day 3.

The *true* incubation period of A could be anywhere between 1 and 3 days (but not all equally likely).

## Issue #2: right truncation

- reporting of events can be triggered by the **secondary** event
- in that case, longer delays might be missing because whilst the *primary events* have occurred the *secondary events* **have not occurred yet**

## Example: right truncation {.smaller}

We are trying to estimate an incubation period. Each arrow represents one person with an associated pair of events (infection and symptom onset).

## Example: right truncation {.smaller}

We are trying to estimate an incubation period. Each arrow represents one person with an associated pair of events (infection and symptom onset).

![](figures/truncation_final.png)

## Example: right truncation {.smaller}

We are trying to estimate an incubation period. Each arrow represents one person with an associated pair of events (infection and symptom onset)

![](figures/truncation_final.png)

On the day of analysis we have not observed some delays yet, and these tended to be **longer**. This is made worse during periods of **exponential growth**. 

## Censoring and right truncation {.smaller}

- When analysing data from an outbreak in real time, we are likely to have double censoring **and** right truncation, making things worse
- In the practical we will only look at the two separately to keep things simple

1. Simulate epidemiological delays with biases
2. Estimate parameters of a delay distribution, correcting for biases
