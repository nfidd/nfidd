### Ensembles: many forecasts into one

![Figure credit: Evan Ray and Nick Reich](figures/ensemble.jpg)

### Why ensemble?

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
1. Models are specialists and you want all the perspectives
    - different data sources
    - different philosophies, e.g. more mechanistic or more statistical approaches
    - different methodologies and parameterizations
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
2. A single "consensus forecast" is easier for decision-makers to digest 
:::

### "Whole is greater than sum of parts"

Average of multiple predictions is often (not always) more performant than any individual model

- Strong evidence in weather & economic forecasting

- Recent evidence in infectious disease forecasting
    - Ebola[@funkAssessingPerformanceRealtime2019]
    - dengue[@colon-gonzalez_probabilistic_2021]
    - flu[@reich_accuracy_2019]
    - COVID-19[@cramer_evaluation_2022]

### Ensemble methods: how to average?

### Ensemble methods: to weight or not?

   - Weight models by past forecast performance
   
      - e.g. using forecast scores
      
   - Rarely better than equal average
   
      - lots of uncertainty in weight estimation!
      - put a "strong prior" on equal weights, both in your mental and statistical models

### Collaborative modelling "hubs"

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Projects run by research groups, public health agencies

- Participation generally open
   
- Standard format enables 
  - data validation
  - ensemble-building
  - model evaluation
  - visualization

### Hubs increasingly used in epi

1. Create unweighted and weighted ensembles using forecasts from multiple models.
2. Evaluate the forecasts from ensembles compared to their constituent models.
