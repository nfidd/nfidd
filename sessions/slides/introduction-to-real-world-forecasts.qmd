### Hubs accelerate scientific discovery {.smaller}

"Comparing the accuracy of forecasting applications is difficult because forecasting methods, forecast outcomes, and reported validation metrics varied widely."

-- Chretien et al., PLOS ONE, 2014

### [The US COVID-19 Forecast Hub](https://covid19forecasthub.org/) {.smaller}

Launched April 2020 by the [Reich Lab](https://reichlab.io) in collaboration with CDC. Goals were to:

- Provide decision-makers and general public with reliable information about where the pandemic is headed in the next month.
- Assess reliability of forecasts and gain insight into which modeling approaches do well.
- Create a community of infectious disease modelers underpinned by an open-science ethos.

### Why is standardization important?

You will learn by doing in this session.

From a practical standpoint, standards facilitate

- visualization
- evaluation
- ensembling

### COVID Hub reboot (2024-present)

In 2024, CDC rebooted the hub, using hubverse standards.

These are the data that you will use in this session.

Use COVID-19 Forecast Hub forecasts to ...

1. create forecast visualizations.
2. evaluate multiple forecast models.
3. create weighted ensembles.
